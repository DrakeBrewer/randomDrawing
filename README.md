# randomDrawing
This is a C program that will read a csv file of id numbers, first names, and last names, assign input amounts of prize money to n lines, and write the winnings to a new csv file as a new field.  
You must have a C compiler to run the program.

## if unfamiliar with C programs. 
Install gcc compiler (if not already installed).  
Navigate to the directory containing the C program.  
Run "gcc randomDrawing.c".  
run "./a.out".  
follow intstructions promtpted in the console.  
There is a "test.csv" file included for testing purposes. For the new test filename, I would recommend "newTest.csv".
